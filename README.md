# Computer Organization 2

This repository contains my work for Computer Organization 2, a course focused on low-level programming and operating system development. The work is divided into independent workshops, a kernel development project, and an evaluated exam, each building on fundamental concepts in system programming and Intel architecture. 

## Workshops Guide:
- Workshops 1-4: Independent exercises introducing Assembly, C, and SIMD.
- Workshops 5-8: Step-by-step development of the kernel, with each workshop adding a core feature.

## Kernel Development:
Starting from Workshop 5, the focus shifts to building a functional kernel from scratch. By Workshop 8, the kernel is fully operational, featuring:
- Protected Mode and segmentation.
- Interrupt Handling and exception management.
- Virtual Memory and paging.
- Multitasking with context switching.
